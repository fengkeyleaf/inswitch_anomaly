Preprocess to get the total count of good and bad packets.

% to drop a good packet is goodCount / totalCount (ex, drop good w/ 30% chance)
% to drop a bad packet is badCount / totalCount   (ex, drop bad w/ 70% chance)



--- Sample ---
incoming packet as (IP, label)

if IP not tracked,
	add entry w/ count & tls = 0.

Increment all TLS for tracket IPs

for current IP, increment count & reset TLS to 0.


If label is good:
	// Drop on < .30, means Add on > .30
	Add to output if randDouble > goodDrop%
Else
	Add to output if randDouble > badDrop%
